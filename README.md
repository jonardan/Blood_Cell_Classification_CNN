# Blood Cell Classification with Deep Learning

**Course**: Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL)  
**Team Members**: Denis Sanduleanu, Jonatan Sciaky, Alessio Caggiano, Mattia Repetti
**Project Group Name**: *Gan‚Äôs n Roses*  

## üìå Overview

This project focuses on classifying images of blood cells into 8 categories using state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques. Starting from a custom CNN and evolving through transfer learning and advanced augmentation strategies, we progressively improved our model's generalization and accuracy.

## üß† Problem

- **Dataset**: 13,759 RGB images (96√ó96) across 8 blood cell classes.
- **Challenges**:
  - Class imbalance.
  - Limited dataset size.
  - Generalization gap between local results and external test platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

We followed an incremental approach:
1. **Custom CNN** ‚Äì Initial attempt, later abandoned due to poor generalization.
2. **Transfer Learning** ‚Äì Used pre-trained ConvNeXt models (Small, Base, Large).
3. **Augmentation** ‚Äì Implemented advanced techniques like:
   - CutMix
   - MixUp
   - RandAugment
   - GridMask
   - CutOut
   - Custom masking
4. **Regularization & Optimization**:
   - Dropout layers
   - L1/L2 regularization
   - Early stopping
   - Optimizers: Adam, Nadam, AdamW, Lion

## üìä Results

Best performance achieved with `ConvNeXtLarge`, trained with the following setup:
- Batch size: 256
- Training set: 42,000 images (augmented)
- Validation set: Augmented with RandAug (70%)
- Fine-tuning: Last 25‚Äì40% of layers trainable
- Optimizer: AdamW (`lr=1e-3`, `weight_decay=1e-5`)
- Dropout: 35%
- Regularization: L1L2 (`1e-3`)
- EarlyStopping: Patience = 4 (fine-tuning phase)

**Final accuracy on the platform**: **83%**
